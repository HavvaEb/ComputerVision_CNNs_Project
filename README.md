Scheduale

- Project: 'Mole detection'
- Duration : '8 days'
- Deadline: '24/05/2022 4:30 (code)'
- Presentation: '25/05/2022 1:30 PM'
- Challenge: 'Solo'
# Description

This project aims to create an application that can predict whether a mole will become malignant based on the image it contains. The app should tell doctors and lab technologists the three most likely diagnoses for a skin lesion. Thus, high-priority patients will be able to be identified quickly and the workflow will be sped up. Moreover, The app should produce results as quickly as possible.To guarantee data privacy, all images must be pre-processed and analyzed locally, and none of the images should be uploaded externally.

# Installation
Libraries used :

- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

- [Keras](https://keras.io/)

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)

# Usage

Three parts make up this project :

 model_notebook — This contains all the codes for the machine learning model_Deep learning model to predict skin lesion based on the defined features.
 
 app.py — This contains Flask APIs that receives mole and classes details through API calls, computes the predicted value based on our model and returns it.

 HTML — This contains the HTML template styling to allow user to enter property details and displays the predicted skin lesion.
